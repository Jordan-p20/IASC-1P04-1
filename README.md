## About the Game

Black Hole Station is a short adventure game where players explore an abandoned space station. As they solve the mystery of the black hole station, players collect items, activate the black hole device, and encounter a mysterious stranger who may be the key to it all. Inspired by Outer Wilds and Ted Chiang's "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate," Black Hole Station conveys the idea that helping others is the best way to help yourself.
